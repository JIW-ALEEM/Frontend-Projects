    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

    <p>Road motorcycles are motorcycles designed for being ridden on paved roads. They feature smooth tires with a light tread pattern and engines generally in the 125 cc and over range. Most are capable of speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), and many of speeds in excess of 125 mph (200 km/h). In India and Pakistan, motorcycles are more popular than cars as means of transport due to low operating and ownership cost. Typical displacements are small (50–450 cc), and as a result these motorcycles give better fuel economy — reportedly 1.25-2.5 l/100km (94-188 mpg) being common</p>

    <p>These motorcycles mimic the style of American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson, even though they have benefited from advances in metallurgy and design. The riding position always places the feet forward. Usually the hands are up and the spine erect or leaning back slightly, which some riders find to be more comfortable for long-distance riding. The riding position of American-style Cruisers and Choppers evolved from the Western Saddle and riding position used by Western cowboys. This position allows greater long-distance comfort, with some compromise of control.</p>

    <p>First we look to the main part in motorcycle is engine. “An engine is a machine that produces mechanical force and motion from another form of energy (e.g. a fuel source, compressed air, or electricity). In engine many part in side like piston in cylinder, valve, chain, spark, and little parts. Number of cylinder is make different power and torque, 1 cylinder and 2,3,4,5, or 6 cylinder is different in power and torque, in cylinder piston is protected by oil which oil protect from over rubbing in piston ,and the small part is sparkplug ,sparkplug have function to burn gasoline before piston doing piston work. And many gears for support the power must go. Engine have two type four stroke and two stroke, four stoke is like perfecting form from two stroke, but two stroke have plus value like simple mechanically and easy to cold start, but two stork produce to much smoke whereas four stroke produce less of smoke, but four stroke engine is more complicated and the four stroke engine is better than two stroke for long distance. And in some year ago born valve control to control speed in low, medium, high. Air cooler or liquid cooler are used too in motorcycle to stabilized power in long time used to control temperature in engine which power of engine can less after use in long time, because of than modern motorcycle have air cooler or liquid cooler. And oil is important part too, oil gives protection from rubbing in piston, you must choose the oil base on your motorcycle specification, because many type of oil, natural and synthetic oil base on ingredients. In oil case is must be written the oil indicator like 20-50, 15- 40, Which means a cold oil flows like a 20 grade but at high temperature it flows like a thicker 50 grade. But now natural oil not be used for now, because synthetic oil better than natural oil, every type motorcycle have different specification, like super sport motorcycle must use more great oil like 5-30 or 10-40 because super sport motorcycle have most power which piston work hard than another motorcycle so piston in super sport motorcycle must have more protection. And for 2stroke and 4stroke have different oil too. You must change oil periodic because oil has periodic life used, if you not change oil your bike would have not good performance, if your oil not good again, oil have mark if oil not good again color of oil is black.</p>

    <p>After we look engine, we go to another important thing is its chassis of motorcycle. Chassis is like frame. Motorcycle chassis usually made from iron and mixture from aluminum. But many company produce chassis innovation to find new material to be chassis, and than they combine with carbon fiber and titanium, which that make expensive than old material. Chassis in motorcycle like bone for human, if chassis do not have good strength maybe chassis can break and can cause accident. Chassis have many different types depending on motorcycle type, like chassis for trail bike, super sport bike, and city bike is different like trail bike have chassis with high ground clear, and super sport bike have lower ground clear and longer than trail bike, and for city bike have not more special specification just for conventional motorcycle to push the price, because city bike is use to daily activity. But in some case chassis can be bent because some crash and if you do not repair it motorcycle cannot be ridden well, because chassis is like the main structure.</p>

    <p>Suspension in the motorcycle is important to because if no suspension in your motorcycle you like ride the horse, suspension like reduce shock in bumpy road, if your motorcycle do not have suspension system they can break the motorcycle chassis. Suspension can make rider have comfort while rider ride the motorcycle like in bumpy road, or in braking condition. Suspensions have some part, like spring, oil or air inside spring, part that connect the chassis part to tire part. Spring is the main part in suspension and then oil or air in inside of spring is in tube that can reduce shock. This part make you must maintained well, if you do not maintained well maybe your suspension can broke like oil in tube broken out and the suspension cannot reduce shock well so you must change the new suspension to get great comfort in your motorcycle.</p>

       <p class="para">Lacrosse originated as a native American sport.[1] In that form, it was a battle between sometimes hundreds of tribesmen, and very often turned violent. Lacrosse today is a rapidly growing sport, one that owes as much to finesse and trickery as it does to brute strength and violence. If you've ever been interested in learning how to play, you've come to the right place. Read on for more information.

        <p class="para">
            &#X2022; If you're just learning how to play, go to your local sporting goods store, and you can find a basic stick for around 30 dollars. If you know someone that has an old stick they wouldn't mind letting you borrow his or hers, even better. Understand that the men's and women's games differ significantly, meaning that the male stick is much different than the female stick.<br>
            &#X2022; There are two main components of a stick:<br>
            &#X2022; The head. This is the (usually plastic) piece at the top of the stick that the ball is controlled with.<br>
            &#X2022; The shaft. Traditionally made out of wood, shafts nowadays are made of strong metal alloys and have varying weights and strength.

            &#X2022; It's used to move the ball up field, catch your opponent out of position while hitting a teammate for an assist, or just getting yourself out of pressure.[2] In order to pass the ball:<br>
            &#X2022; Lower your dominant hand down to just above the center of the shaft. Keep your non-dominant hand close to the bottom of the shaft.<br>
            &#X2022; Bring the shaft of your stick back by twisting your shoulders toward your dominant side. Don't let it hook around your neck.<br>
            &#X2022; Keeping the head next to your ear, and using a straight motion, flick the wrist of your top hand while pulling your bottom hand towards you.<br>
            &#X2022; Make sure to follow through with the motion. A proper motion will see the top of the shaft move directly over the bottom of the shaft in a straight line.<br>
            &#X2022; Note: eventually, you learn how your stick throws and can adjust the way you throw to be more accurate.<br>
            &#X2022; Note: the best thing you can do to help improve your skills is get to a brick wall and play "wall ball." This is where you stand a few feet from the wall and throw the ball against it. The ball will bounce back and you practice catching it.

            &#X2022; With your dominant hand up near the bottom of your head,(For righties this means have your right hand on top and left hand on the bottom and for lefties this means have your left hand at the top and right hand at the bottom) watch the ball travel through the air and into your pocket. Make sure you don't cradle as the ball enters your stick. Instead of cradling, simply loosen your grip on your top hand; as the ball enters the stick, let the momentum of the ball push the whole stick back a little bit.[3] Again, wall ball will really help here.

            &#X2022; Shooting the bass is necessary in order to score goals. Move your dominant hand down a little lower than you would to pass. Perform the same basic movement as passing, except this time, put more force behind it. There are plenty of different kinds of shots in lacrosse — 3/4, sidearm, underhand — but for now, focus on overhand shots.<br>
            &#X2022; Try to direct the shots on the corners of the goal. The goalie has a harder time against shots that aren't directed right at him, so aim for top right, top left, bottom right, and bottom left. Also try shooting at the goalies weak side hip. So if the goalie is right handed, shoot at their left hip. Shooting at the goalies weak side hip make it hard for them to stop the ball mainly because it takes a lot speed and quick reflexes for the goalie to extend their arms with the stick across to the opposite side of their body, whether they move their stick upwards or downwards.<br>
            &#X2022; Try bounce shots. Bounce shots are where you bounce the ball on the ground before it gets to the goal. Bounce shots are hard for a goalie to defend, so use them.

            &#X2022;  Nothing impresses a coach more than being ambidextrous! Learning to use both hands requires patience, because it will not happen overnight. Using your off hand in games will seriously improve your play.<br>
            &#X2022;  A good way to learn your off-hand skills is to look at what your dominate hand is doing. Mirror the way you are passing. Go through the same motions.<br>
            &#X2022;  After you do this, spend a week of practice using nothing but your non-dominant hand. During line drills, 6v6, fast break, anything. Only use your off-hand. This will be very frustrating, but keep at it.

            &#X2022; As you play in more lacrosse games, it's important to watch more experienced team members move without the ball. Even players who don't have the ball play a very important role in a possession. You must know when to cut, and make space for passing, and shooting, and to draw defenders away from the person with the ball. You also should learn how and when to set picks for your teammates.

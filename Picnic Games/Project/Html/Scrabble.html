       <h3>Things You Should Know</h3>
       <br>
       <p>If you place the first word in Scrabble, then you receive a Double Word Bonus for the word you played. For example, you'll earn 20 points for a 10-point word.
        When it's your turn to make a move, build off of another person's word for your word to be valid. For instance, use the "n" in "friend" to spell "pension."
        Make sure that when you spell out words, you place letters in a horizontal row or a vertical column rather than in a diagonal line, which is not allowed.
        At the end of your turn, draw new tiles to replace any tiles you used to spell out a word. Keep 7 tiles in your rack for each play unless you can't draw any more.</p>

        <p>The goal of Scrabble is to earn the highest score by the end of the game.
            You earn points by spelling words with letter tiles. There all sorts of strategies you can use—for example, you can spell words with high value letters like "Q" and "Z" (both of which are worth 10 points each), or you can earn an enormous amount of points by placing letter tiles on big-ticket "Premium Squares," like Triple Letter Bonuses or even Triple Word Bonuses. If you love creativity and showing off your vocabulary, then this is definitely the board game for you.[1]
            Scrabble is finished once all the players have used all their tiles, all the tiles in the bag have already been drawn, or there are no longer any words that can be played.

        <p>1
            Set up the Scrabble board, letter racks, and letter tiles.
            Lay out the board, put all 100 letter tiles in the cloth bag that's included with the game, and put out 1 letter rack per player. Make sure each letter rack is placed in front of 1 of the 4 sides on the board.[2]
            Give everyone a piece of paper and a pencil, too. That way, they can keep track of all their points.
            If your crew wants to be extra fancy, each player can bring their very own Scrabble score notebook.</p></b>

    Agree on a dictionary to use for challenges.</h3>

        <p>
            At some point during the game, it’s possible that someone might play a word that another player thinks is invalid. In this kind of situation, you’ll need to look up the word in a dictionary. Make sure everyone is on the same page about the dictionary you’ll use, then refer to it whenever challenges come up. Or, use the official “Word Checker for Scrabble®” app instead. Words that are always off limits include:[3]
            Proper nouns—nouns that are always capitalized—like names and places.
            Abbreviations, like “CIA,” “FBI,” or “USA.”
            Prefixes or suffixes by themselves, like “anti-” or “-ful.”
            Hyphenated words, like “short-term” or “old-fashioned.”
            Any other incomplete and unofficial English word, like “ridic” (for “ridiculous”).

        <p>
            To make sure you randomize all the letters so no one knows what they’re pulling, fill the bag with all the tiles, use the drawstring to close it, and shake them around. Whoever goes first is based on the tile they pull, which is left up entirely to chance.

        <p>
            Pass the bag around the table and let each player draw 1 tile. Next, each person places their tile face up on the table. The player with the letter that is closest to the letter “A” makes the first Scrabble play. If anyone draws a blank tile, they automatically start the game.[4]
            After sorting out the order everyone will go in, put all the letter tiles back in the bag and shuffle them again.

            5
Fill your rack with 7 tiles.</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c6/Play-Scrabble-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-728px-Play-Scrabble-Step-6-Version-6.jpg.webp" alt="...">
        <p>
Let the person who drew the tile closest to “A” go first. Hold the bag above eye level so they can’t see any of the tiles. Once everyone else takes out 7 tiles, make sure they put them onto their tile rack. Then, have them pass the bag to the next player until everyone has drawn their letters and filled their tile racks.[5]
Do not show your tiles to your fellow players. Part of the fun in playing Scrabble is all the fun surprises when you see what someone else spells out (or when you dazzle everyone with an epic word choice).</p>

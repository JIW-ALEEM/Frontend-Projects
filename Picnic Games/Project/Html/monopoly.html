       <p class="para">Monopoly is a classic board game loved by people of all ages, but it can be pretty tough to learn to play! The rules are complicated, and many families have their own variations that aren't listed in the official rulebook. Learning how to set up the board, play by the official rules, and end the game at a reasonable time will help you learn to love Monopoly!

        <h3>1
            Find 2 to 8 players.</h3>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="../Images/monopoly/img1.jfif"  alt="..." style=" border: 2px solid black;">
        <p class="para"><ul> Monopoly can be played with as few as 2 people up to 8 players at most. Each number of players brings its own advantages and drawbacks so it is important to know them before you decide on how many people are going to play.[1]<br> </ul>
           <li> 2-person games are not recommended due to the nature and mechanics of the game. At the start of the game, both players will be evenly matched and find the game to last a long time. Once someone gets lucky or makes a great move, they usually win the game without a chance for their opponent to catch up. Do not let this deter you though if you only have two available players. It can still be very fun.<br></li>
           <li>  3-5 person games are great because of their balance between fairness and enjoyment. Games can last over two hours if players are evenly matched and when someone appears to be winning, there's a lot of room for the losing players to stay in the game.<br></li>
            <li> 6-8 person games are fun but can have a few problems. As only one person can win the game, more players means there will be more losers. Furthermore, there is a longer wait between turns, yet this isn't too much of an issue as Monopoly gives you a handful of options you can do when it's not your turn, until everyone wants to do an action at once.<br></li>
                <li> Monopoly is intended to be played by people aged 8 or over. Younger players may not enjoy the game if they do not like to lose as the game requires some strategy to win. It is recommended to help new and young players by offering tips and opting for a more co-operative playstyle.<br></li>
                    <li> Monopoly can be played online too. There are various official and unofficial versions.<br></li>

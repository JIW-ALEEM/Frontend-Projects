        <h3>HOW TO PLAY ?</h3> 
       <p class="para">If you're looking for a fun card game to play with friends, give Uno a try! Each player gets dealt a hand of 7 Uno cards to start. To play, you’ll match one of your cards with the card that's been dealt from the draw pile. The first player to get rid of all of their cards wins the round. Then all players tally up their scores. The game continues until one person scores 500 points. We’ll walk you through the main Uno instructions, and a few variations you can try once you get the hang of this fun card game.

          Pay attention to action and Wild cards.</h3>

        <p class="para"><ul> In addition to basic Uno cards that have numbers on them, there are 3 types of action cards. If you play a Wild card, you choose the color for the next play. If you put down a Draw 2, the player next to you must take 2 cards, and their turn is skipped. If you play Reverse, you change the direction of play, so the person who went before you will then have another turn.[6]<br>
           <li> A Reverse card has 2 arrows that are going in opposite directions.<br></li>
           <li>If you get a Skip card, which is a card that has a circle with a slash through it, the player next to you must skip their turn.<br></li>
           <li> According to Uno rules for 2 players, Reverse works like Skip if you're playing with just 2 people. That means your opponent has to skip a turn and you get to immediately play another card.<br></li>
           <li> For 2 players, if you play a Draw 2 or Wild Draw 4 card, the other person has to draw the number of cards and then you resume play on your turn again.<br></li>
           <li> Did You Know? Playing a Wild Draw 4 card is like playing a standard Wild card, but it makes the next player draw 4 cards and skip their turn as well.<br></li>

           <li> To score a hand, give the winner of the round:[8]<br></li>
           <li> 20 points for each Draw 2, Reverse, or Skip card in an opponent's hand<br></li>
           <li> 50 points for Wild and Wild Draw 4 cards<br></li>
           <li> The face value for number cards (for example, an 8 card equals 8 points)<br></li>
